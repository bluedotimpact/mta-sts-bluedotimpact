# mta-sts

MTA-STS policy configuration hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This handles inbound emails to our old domain, `bluedotimpact.org` (which redirects these emails to `bluedot.org`)

See [mta-sts-bluedot](https://github.com/bluedotimpact/mta-sts-bluedot) for more explanation of MTA-STS.
